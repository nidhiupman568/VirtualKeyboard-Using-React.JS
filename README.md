# 🎹 Virtual Keyboard Project Using React.JS 🎹

🎉 Welcome to the **Virtual Keyboard** project! 🎉 This innovative and interactive tool allows users 👥 to type 🖊️ seamlessly using a software-based virtual keyboard ⌨️ built with **ReactJS** ⚛️. The project implements functional components 🧩 and manages state 🔄 efficiently. Users can interact 🤲 with the virtual keyboard ⌨️ by clicking 🖱️ on keys, which allows for a smooth and responsive typing experience ⌨️. The keypress 🔑 and character input logic 🧩 are implemented using **JSX** 🖥️.

## 📋 Description

The **Virtual Keyboard** ⌨️ is a software-based input interface 💻 that mimics a physical keyboard ⌨️ on a digital device 🖥️. Its key functionalities 🧩 include:

- **User Input Simulation** 💬: Allows users 👥 to input text 🖋️ and commands 🖥️ by clicking 🖱️ on virtual keys 🔑, replicating the functionality of a physical keyboard ⌨️.
- **Accessibility** ♿: Enhances accessibility for individuals with physical disabilities 👩‍🦽👨‍🦽 by providing alternative input methods 🖥️.
- **Security** 🔐: Used for secure data entry 🛡️, protecting against keyloggers 🔒 and other security threats 🚫.
- **Integration** 🔄: Can be integrated into various applications 🖥️, including kiosks 🏬, touch-screen devices 📱, and software interfaces 💻, to facilitate text input 🖋️ and interaction 🤝.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used / Prerequisites

- **ReactJS** ⚛️: JavaScript library 📚 for building user interfaces 🖥️.
- **CSS** 🎨: For styling 🎨 the virtual keyboard ⌨️.
- **JSX** 🖥️: Syntax extension for JavaScript 💻.
- **Functional Components in React** ⚛️: For creating reusable components 🧩.

## 🚀 Approach and Functionalities

To create 🛠️ the Virtual Keyboard ⌨️ application, the project involves:

### Steps to Create the Application

1. **Set Up** 🛠️ a React project ⚛️ using the command 🖥️:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app <<name_of_project>> 🎉
   ```

2. **Navigate** 🚶‍♂️ to the project folder 📂 using:

   ```bash
   cd <<Name_of_project>> 📂
   ```

3. **Install** 📥 the required modules 🔄 using:

   ```bash
   npm i styled-components 💅
   ```

4. **Create** 🛠️ a folder called `components` 📂 and add 🖥️ two new files 📄 inside it:
   - `Keyboard.js` ⌨️
   - `Keyboard.css` 🎨

5. **Import** 📥 the icon pack 🌟 into the `index.html` file 📂 of the `public` folder 📂:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.2.0/css/all.min.css" integrity="sha512-xh6O/CkQoPOWDdYTDqeRdPCVd1SpvCA9XXcUnZS2FmJNp1coAFzvtCN9BmamE+4aHK8yyUHUSCcJHgXloTyT2A==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" />
   ```

### Example Code

- **`index.html`** 🖥️: This is an automatically created file 📂 in the `public` folder 📂. We just need to import 🖥️ the icon pack 🌟 in its `<head>` tag 🖥️.

- **`App.js`** ⚛️: This file 📄 imports the `Keyboard` ⌨️ component 🧩 and exports it 🖥️.

- **`Keyboard.js`** ⌨️: This file 📄 contains the logic 🧩 for the virtual keyboard ⌨️, keypress 🔑, and input text block 🖋️ with state variable 🔄 which the computer 💻 chooses a value 🖥️.

- **`Keyboard.css`** 🎨: This file 📄 contains the design 🎨 of the Virtual Keyboard ⌨️ elements 🧩.

## 🏗️ How to Run the Project

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
